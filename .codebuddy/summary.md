## Project Summary

### Overview
This project is a Python-based application called "mercbot" that will be capable of autonomously playing the online game Mercatorio, or optionally just providing quality of life features.

### Goal:
Develop an intelligent bot that can play the game Mercatorio automatically, focusing on maximizing prestige and profit for a maritime character. The bot should balance items, manage production chains, and perform other in-game activities. The bot will also be able to handle multiple accounts and automatically determine production chains based on available buildings and transports.

### Progress:

Created a project structure using Poetry.
Developed scripts to initialize settings and load them into a SQLite database.
Implemented basic item balancing and production management functions.
Ensured the setup is modular and can handle multiple accounts.
Implemented tests for initialization and production functions.

This project has a structured setup with separate directories for models, setup, utils, and tests, indicating a modular design approach. The main functionality is likely in the `/mercbot` directory, with important configuration files like `.env` and `settings.py` present. Testing is also considered, with a dedicated `/tests` directory containing test files.
